The contributors guide is still a work in progress and is in temporary form

All contributions are apprecitated, while its always most ideal to use the pull request process to fix errors when you find them directly, it is also extremely valuable if you cant update directly, if you could please open an issue in github

If you are new to contributing to github, the git lab guide walks through the process from a beginners perspective, using command line tools. You can [view the Git lab here](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/LabGuides/Lab12-Git)

Also keep in mind the easiest way for those new to update a given page is by using the built in editor in the github web page. We recommend you get used to using a text editor and command line tools for your own learning benefit, but if you see an error and arent familiar or dont have the tools handy to update via CLI, keep in mind you can always make quick updates from the browser

In terms of style and formatting, when you make contributions, try to emulate the style and formatting that you see in the existing lab guides that are complete. Always use hidden/expanding blocks for images and any long explanations. 

Thank you for contributing!
